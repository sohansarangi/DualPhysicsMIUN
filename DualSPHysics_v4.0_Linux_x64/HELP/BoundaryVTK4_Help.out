BoundaryVTK4 v4.0.014 (13-04-2016)
===================================
Information about parameters of execution:

  BoundaryVTK4 <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration from a file

    -info          Shows information of loaded data

  Load shapes:
    -loadvtk <file.vtk>  Loads shapes from vtk files (PolyData)
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of the shapes to be loaded, affects
                         only the previous -loadvtk instruction and can not be
                         used with -onlyid
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the code of object of the shapes to be
                         loaded, only affects the previous -loadvtk instruction
    -changemk:<value>    Changes the mk of the loaded shapes to a given value,
                         only affects the previous -loadvtk instruction 

    -loadply:<mk> <file.ply>  Loads shapes from ply files with indicated mk
    -loadstl:<mk> <file.stl>  Loads shapes from stl files with indicated mk

  Load configuration for a mobile boundary:
    -filexml file.xml    Loads xml file with information of the movement and
                         types of particles

    -motiontime:<time>:<step> Configures the duration and time step to
                         simulate the movement defined in the xml file, 
                         can not be used with -motiondatatime and -motiondata

    -motiondatatime <dir>  Indicates the directory where real times of the
                         simulation are loaded for the mobile boundary
                         can not be used with -motiontime and -motiondata

    -motiondata <dir>    Indicates the directory where position of particles
                         are loaded to generate the mobile boundary
                         can not be used with -motiontime and -motiondatatime

  Define output files:
    -savemotion <file>   Generates file with movement of the objects
    -savevtk <file.vtk>  Generates vtk(polydata) files with the loaded shapes
    -saveply <file.ply>  Generates ply file with the loaded information
    -savestl <file.stl>  Generates stl file with the loaded information
    -savevtkdata <file.vtk>  Generates vtk(polydata) file with the loaded
                         shapes including mk and shape code

    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of the shapes to be stored, affects
                         only the previous out option and
                         can not be used with -onlyid
    -onlyid:<values>     Indicates the code of the object of the shapes to be
                         stored, affects only the previous out option
    -filemove <file>     Loads file with displacement

  Examples:
    BoundaryVtk4 -loadvtk bound.vtk -savevtk box.vtk -onlymk:10,12

    BoundaryVtk4 -loadvtk bound.vtk -filexml case.xml -motiondata .
                -saveply motion.ply
