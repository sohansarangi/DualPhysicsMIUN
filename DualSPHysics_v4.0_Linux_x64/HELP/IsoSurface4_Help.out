IsoSurface v4.0.006 (15-04-2016)
=================================
Information about parameters of execution:

  IsoSurface4 <options>

  Basic options:
    -h             Shows information about parameters
    -opt <file>    Loads configuration of a file

  Define input file:
    -dirin <dir>       Directory with particle data
    -casein <casename> Name of case file with particle data

    -filexml file.xml  Loads xml file with information of mk and
                       type of particles, this is needed for the filter
                       -onlymk and for the variable -vars:mk
    -first:<int>     Indicates the first file to be computed
    -last:<int>      Indicates the last file to be computed
    -files:<values>  Indicates the number of files to be processed

    -move:x:y:z      Particles are moved using this offset

    -threads:<int>   Indicates the number of threads for parallel execution of
     the interpolation, it takes the number of cores of the device by default
     (or uses zero value).

  Define input data:
    -onlypos:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax  Indicates limits of particles
    -onlyposfile filters.xml  Indicates XML file with filters to apply
    -onlymk:<values>     Indicates the mk of selected particles
    -onlytype:<values>   Indicates the type of selected particles
       (+ means include, - means do not include)
       +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
       +/-bound:     Boundary particles (fixed, moving and floating)
       +/-fixed:     Boundary fixed particles
       +/-moving:    Boundary moving particles
       +/-floating:  Floating body particles
       +/-fluid:     Fluid particles (no excluded)
       (Preselected types: fluid)

    -vars:<values>  Indicates the variables to be computed and stored
       (+ means include, - means do not include)
       +/-all:       To choose or reject all options
       +/-idp:       Id of particle
       +/-vel:       Velocity
       +/-rhop:      Density
       +/-press:     Pressure
       +/-mass:      Mass
       +/-vol:       Volume
       +/-type:      Type (fixed,moving,floating,fluid)
       +/-mk:        Value of mk associated to the particles
       +/-ace:       Acceleration
       +/-vor:       Vorticity
       +/-XXX:       Variable defined by the user
       (Preselected variables: vel)

  Define parameters for acceleration or vorticity calculation:
    -viscoart:<float>      Artificial viscosity [0-1]
    -viscolam:<float>      Laminar viscosity [order of 1E-6]
    -gravity:<float:float:float> Gravity value

  Set the configuration of interpolation:
    -distinter_2h:<float>  Coefficient of 2h that defines the maximum distance
                           for the interaction among particles depending on 2h
                           (default value = 1.0)
    -distinter:<float>     Defines the maximum distance for the interaction
                           among particles in an absolute way.

    -kclimit:<float>       Defines the minimum value of sum_wab_vol to apply
                           the Kernel Correction (default value = 0.05)
    -kcdummy:<float>       Defines the dummy value for the interpolated
                           quantity if Kernel Correction is not applied
                           (default value = 0)
    -kcusedummy:<0/1>      Defines whether or not to use the dummy value
                           (default value = 1)

  Set the configuration of isosurface:
    -iso_limits:xmin:ymin:zmin:xmax:ymax:zmax Isosurface limits are adjusted to
     the given limits

    -distnode_dp:<float>   Defines the distance between nodes by multiplying dp
     and the given value (option by default)
    -distnode:<float>      Distance between nodes is given

  Define output files:
    -saveiso <file.vtk>    Generates VTK files (polydata) with the isosuface
     calculated starting from a variable mass and using the limit value. When
     limit value is not given, the threshold mass value of the fluid is
     considered (0.5*fluid particle mass)
    -saveiso:var:<values> <file.vtk>   Generates VTK files (polydata) with the
     isosuface calculated starting from a variable given and using the limit
     value.

  Examples:
    IsoSurface4 -saveiso fileiso
